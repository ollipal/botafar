# Arduino tutorial

Coming soon. The plan is to have similar tutorial to the [Raspberry Pi one](raspi): remotely controlling LEDs and servos.

The plan is to have two parts: 

1. Controlling using Arduino's official [Firmata Library](https://docs.arduino.cc/hacking/software/FirmataLibrary) and [pyFirmata2](https://github.com/berndporr/pyFirmata2), which allows remote controlling hardware using only Python
2. Using [pyserial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on Python to send and receive serial commands from Arduino and its C++ code

If someone familiar with some or all of these technologies wants to help with these tutorials, write to [Github Discussions](https://github.com/ollipal/botafar/discussions/categories/general) or create a [a pull request](https://github.com/ollipal/botafar/pulls)!
