# Quickstart help

Help with [the quickstart](https://docs.telebotties.com/quickstart) quide:

## Executing Python file

On most operating systems, executing a file called **bot.py** can be done with a command:

```
python bot.py
```

but it can also be:

```
python3 bot.py
```

or

```
py bot.py
```

If none of these work, check the [detailed installation instructions](install.md) for more help.

## Connectiong to browser

The command `tb.run` will print a link that will create a connection between browser and the program.

It should work with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari (also mobile versions) if:

- The program is running on the same device

or

- The device is in **the same local network (Wi-Fi or wired)**

**Firefox can sometimes get stuck for an unknown reason, so please refresh the page/restart the program** (or try some other browser).

## Still stuck?

If you cannot get the quickstart to work, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ollipal/telebotties-web/issues) to get help!
