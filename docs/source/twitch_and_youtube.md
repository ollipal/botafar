# Twitch & YouTube

Botafar makes streaming you bot to Twitch or YouTube simple by integrating with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) through their built-in browser source.

Without streaming to Twitch/YouTube, only the owner and currently remote controlling player can see the low-latency livestream and related print messages on screen. Botafar also does not support many social features such as chatting between players and between player and the owner, so this should be done through other platforms.
