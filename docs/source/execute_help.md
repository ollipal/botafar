# Executing Python file

On most operating systems, executing a file called **bot.py** can be done with a command:

```
python bot.py
```

but it can also be:

```
python3 bot.py
```

or

```
py bot.py
```

If none of these work, check the [detailed installation instructions](install.md) for more help.
