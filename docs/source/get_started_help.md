Help with [Get started guide](get_started.md) quide:

## Executing Python file

On most operating systems, executing a file called **main.py** can be done with a command:

```
python main.py
```

but it can also be:

```
python3 main.py
```

or

```
py main.py
```

If none of these work, check the [detailed installation instructions](install.md) for more help.
