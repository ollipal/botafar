## Use pre-commit hooks

Run `pip install pre-commit` and then `pre-commit install`



> **NOTE**: this process does not run `markdownlint` by default as it
requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to be installed. If you want
to run `markdownlint` locally as well,
[install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
and install markdown lint with `gem install mdl -v 0.11.0` and uncomment lines from `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
